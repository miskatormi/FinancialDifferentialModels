# FinancialDEModels
Numerical simulation of deterministic and stochastic financial models using Runge-Kutta, Euler-Maruyama and Monte Carlo methods.
## Motivation
This repository showcases my interest in financial modeling, data analysis, programming, and mathematics. While studying physics, I developed a strong fascination with the mathematical and computational aspects of financial markets. This project represents a selection of my personal work exploring such models.
